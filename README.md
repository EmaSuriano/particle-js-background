# Particle JS Vanilla Background Generator

> ParticleJS Background ready to use and can be customizable via the parameters inside the url.

## Context

I like to use particle-js as a background for my project and I always have to installed the dependency and customize it, which takes me a few minutes to accomplish. So I decided to deploy this simple app which would be always accesible to anyone and also can change the way the particles work and see!

## Using it

As I said this is accesible to anyone, I decided to host the applicaiton in github pages.
